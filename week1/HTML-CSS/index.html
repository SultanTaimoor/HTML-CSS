    <p class="my-education-paragraph"><strong>EDUCATION <br><br>
      2009 - 2013</strong> Baluchistan University of Information Technology Engineering and Management Sciences<br><br>
      BS(Hons) â€“ Geological Engineering (CGPA 2.65)<br>Gained strong understanding of reservoir engineering, reservoir management and simulation,
      well testing (DST and surface facility), well designing, off-shore and on-shore drilling operations,
      production engineering techniques, well logging and seismic data application.<br></p>
    <ul><li><strong>Relevant Modules: Drilling Engineering, Principles of Reservoir Simulation, Well Testing,
      Principles of Enhanced Oil Recovery, Well Logging, Geophysical Exploration, Seismic Data
      Acquisition and Interpretation, Petroleum Geology, Stratigraphy, Structural Geology, Physical
      Geology, Petrology, Hydrology, Explosive Engineering, Soil Mechanics, Project Management,
      Engineering Management, Computer Science and Numerical Analysis.></strong></li></ul>

    <ul><li><strong>Independent Mapping Project: Conducted a 14 days geological fieldwork in Chaman fault line
      region of Quetta using field maps, sections and observations to produce a detailed geological
      contour map and accompanying 5000 word report. Demonstrated the ability to organize my
      work effectively and stay focused in a challenging working environment.</strong></li></ul>

    <ul><li><strong>Mini Project: Well Logging. The project involved acquiring and interpreting seismic data obtained
        from sonic logs, potential logs and density logs - applying the acquired data to correlate the oil
        well.</strong></li></ul>

    <ul><li><strong>Final Year Project: Engineering Properties of Soil. The project involved running a suite of
          experiments on different soil samples for ground stability and soil strength in order to evaluate
          the appropriate drilling methods for safe drilling of oil wells.</strong></li></ul>
